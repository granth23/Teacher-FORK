The above project is a fork of a private repo with removed keys and was developed for the professors of WILP, a department of our college as a part of my Internship at the company. It is a question paper setting and question bank maintaining website for the professors where the questions are generated by GPT with prompts from the professor.

If you wanna run the website
1) Download the Repo
2) Make sure you have python 3.7
3) Download all python reqs "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4) Add GPT keys to generation.py #6
5) Add Firebase credentials in secret/firebase.json
    5.1 Add data for professors and courses
6) Add oauth keys in secret/oauth.json
7) Run "python app.py"

Live Demo can be given for the same.

Thank You
